# Energy Flux - Minecraft API

This Datapack is an API to use if you want to create Industrial Datapacks.
It will create the energy system and will do the transferts for you.

Here is a tutorial to "how to implement" :
- Tags : x
- Scores : x

Also, there is an example of Datapack that use the Energy Flux API : https://github.com/Stoupy51/SimplEnergy
You can copy it to get a good start if you want to add your customs items using energy.
I recommend you to download SimplEnergy and work with Energy Flux too.

Datapack rules :
Always name your scores and tags with a unique prefix to avoid Datapacks compabilities,
for Energy Flux I use "EF_", and "SE_" for SimplEnergy.

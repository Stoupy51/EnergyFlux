This Datapack is an API to use if you want to create Industrial Datapacks.
It will create the energy system and will do the transferts for you.

Here is a tutorial to "how to implement" :
- Tags : x
- Scores : x
Tutorial video : Coming soon

Also, there is an example of Datapack that use the Energy Flux API : https://github.com/Stoupy51/SimplEnergy
You can copy it to get a good start if you want to add your customs items using energy.
I recommend you to download SimplEnergy and work with Energy Flux too.

Datapack rules :
Always name your scores and tags with a unique prefix to avoid Datapacks compabilities,
for Energy Flux I use "EF_", and "SE_" for SimplEnergy.
